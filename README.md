The employee directory is an application for the corporate intranet. It's used to store information such as name, function, department, location, email and other data.

I created this application as a means of learning web development. In addition it's something that many companies don't have, and it is very useful in the communication of day to day work.

## Features 
- Automatic drop-down menus based on department and function.

- Direct link to send email or chat via Skype for Business.
- Logo of the company in the home page.
